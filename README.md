# Weather-App
The purpose of the project was to learn how to use nodejs. The web application asks the user to input a location, and it displays the current temperature (user specifies either Fahrenheit or Celsius) with the appropriate icon. The program calls two APIs (google maps and forecast.io). The application uses expressjs and also socket.io to connect the client-side and server-side.
